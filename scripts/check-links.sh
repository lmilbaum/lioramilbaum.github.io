# Network check. CI runs it as a non-blocking last step of the build job (the site
# build itself is offline); run it by hand too. GETs every absolute http(s) href on
# a built page and prints "<code> <url>". Exits non-zero if any response is not 2xx.
# The LinkedIn share-offsite URL is skipped: it redirects to a login page.
#
# Checks start in batches of 10 background jobs, and each batch waits for its slowest
# job before the next starts. A job takes at most one link's retry budget (about
# 66 s), or about 200 s for a discussion comment lookup (up to 3 API pages, each with
# the same budget). So the worst case is the sum over batches: 66 s for a batch of
# links only, 200 s for a batch with a comment lookup. This page has 13 links and 7
# comment lookups (20 jobs), in two batches of 10: 10 links, then 3 links and 7
# lookups. The worst case is 66 s + 198 s = 264 s (a lookup is 3 pages of 66 s), inside
# CI's 5-minute step timeout with 36 s to spare. The second batch is full: no job slots
# are left. A 21st job starts a third batch, which adds at least 66 s and takes the
# worst case past 300 s, so the time budget must change before a job past 20 is added.
# Check that sum before adding links or comment lookups.
#
# Discussion comment links (https://github.com/<o>/<r>/discussions/<n>#discussioncomment-<id>)
# are also looked up through the REST API: 200 if the discussion has the comment,
# 404 if it does not. The lookup reads only the first 300 comments (3 pages of 100),
# so a comment beyond that reports 404 as a false warning. A missing discussion also
# reports 404. GITHUB_TOKEN, if set, raises the API rate limit and is sent to
# api.github.com only.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-links.sh [PAGE]   (default: the built hackathon page)
# shellcheck disable=SC2329 # get, link and comment are called indirectly, by start.
